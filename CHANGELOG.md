## 7.62.0

### Important Changes

- **feat(integrations): Add `ContextLines` integration for html-embedded JS stack frames (#8699)**

This release adds the `ContextLines` integration as an optional integration for the Browser SDKs to `@sentry/integrations`.

This integration adds source code from inline JavaScript of the current page's HTML (e.g. JS in `<script>` tags) to stack traces of captured errors.
It _can't_ collect source code from assets referenced by your HTML (e.g. `<script src="..." />`).

The `ContextLines` integration is useful when you have inline JS code in HTML pages that can't be accessed by Sentry's backend, for example, due to a login-protected page.

```js
import { ContextLines } from "@sentry/integrations";

Sentry.init({
  // ...
  integrations: [
    new ContextLines({
      // The number of lines to collect before and after each stack frame's line number
      // Defaults to 7
      frameContextLines: 7,
    }),
  ],
});
```

## 7.61.0

### Important Changes

- **feat(node-experimental): Add `@sentry/node-experimental` package as MVP for POTEL (#8609)**

This introduces a new, *experimental* package, `@sentry/node-experimental`.
This is a variant of the Node SDK which uses OpenTelemetry under the hood for performance instrumentation.

Note that this package is very much WIP, considered unstable and may change at any time.
**No SemVer guarantees apply whatsoever.** Still, if you're brave enough you can give it a try.
[Read more about @sentry/node-experimental](./packages/node-experimental/README.md)

### Other Changes

- fix(node): Don't set extra baggage headers (#8657)
- fix(tracing): Trim idle transaction spans if they exceed final timeout (#8653)

## 7.60.1

- fix(nextjs): Match folder paths with trailing separator (#8615)
- fix(replay): Ignore clicks with `shift` pressed (#8648)
- fix(replay): Use `session.started` for min/max duration check (#8617)

## 7.60.0

### Important Changes

- **feat(replay): Ensure min/max duration when flushing (#8596)**

We will not send replays that are <5s long anymore. Additionally, we also added further safeguards to avoid overly long (>1h) replays.
You can optionally configure the min. replay duration (defaults to 5s):

```js
new Replay({
  minReplayDuration: 10000 // in ms - note that this is capped at 15s max!
})
```

### Other Changes

- fix(profiling): Align to SDK selected time origin (#8599)
- fix(replay): Ensure multi click has correct timestamps (#8591)
- fix(utils): Truncate aggregate exception values (LinkedErrors) (#8593)

## 7.59.3

- fix(browser): 0 is a valid index (#8581)
- fix(nextjs): Ensure Webpack plugin is available after dynamic require (#8584)
- types(browser): Add browser profiling client options (#8565)

## 7.59.2

Please see [7.59.0](#7590) for the changes in that release.

## 7.59.1

No changes. This release was published to fix a publishing issue with 7.59.0.
Please see [7.59.0](#7590) for the changes in that release.

## 7.59.0

### Important Changes

- **- feat(remix): Add Remix v2 support (#8415)**

This release adds support for Remix v2 future flags, in particular for new error handling utilities of Remix v2. We heavily recommend you switch to using `v2_errorBoundary` future flag to get the best error handling experience with Sentry.

To capture errors from [v2 client-side ErrorBoundary](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/route/error-boundary-v2), you should define your own `ErrorBoundary` in `root.tsx` and use `Sentry.captureRemixErrorBoundaryError` helper to capture the error.

```typescript
// root.tsx
import { captureRemixErrorBoundaryError } from "@sentry/remix";

export const ErrorBoundary: V2_ErrorBoundaryComponent = () => {
  const error = useRouteError();

  captureRemixErrorBoundaryError(error);

  return <div> ... </div>;
};
```

For server-side errors, define a [`handleError`](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/file-conventions/entry.server#handleerror) function in your server entry point and use the `Sentry.captureRemixServerException` helper to capture the error.

```ts
// entry.server.tsx
export function handleError(
  error: unknown,
  { request }: DataFunctionArgs
): void {
  if (error instanceof Error) {
    Sentry.captureRemixServerException(error, "remix.server", request);
  } else {
    // Optionally capture non-Error objects
    Sentry.captureException(error);
  }
}
```

For more details, see the Sentry [Remix SDK](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/remix/) documentation.

## 7.58.1

- fix(node): Set propagation context even when tracingOptions are not defined (#8517)

## 7.58.0

### Important Changes

- **Performance Monitoring not required for Distributed Tracing**

This release adds support for [distributed tracing](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/usage/distributed-tracing/) without requiring performance monitoring to be active on the JavaScript SDKs (browser and node). This means even if there is no sampled transaction/span, the SDK will still propagate traces to downstream services. Distributed Tracing can be configured with the `tracePropagationTargets` option, which controls what requests to attach the `sentry-trace` and `baggage` HTTP headers to (which is what propagates tracing information).

```js
Sentry.init({
  tracePropagationTargets: ["third-party-site.com", /^https:\/\/yourserver\.io\/api/],
});
```

- feat(tracing): Add tracing without performance to browser and client Sveltekit (#8458)
- feat(node): Add tracing without performance to Node http integration (#8450)
- feat(node): Add tracing without performance to Node Undici (#8449)
- feat(node): Populate propagation context using env variables (#8422)

- **feat(core): Support `AggregateErrors` in `LinkedErrors` integration (#8463)**

This release adds support for [`AggregateErrors`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/AggregateError). AggregateErrors are considered as Exception Groups by Sentry, and will be visualized and grouped differently. See the [Exception Groups Changelog Post](https://changelog.getsentry.com/announcements/exception-groups-now-supported-for-python-and-net) for more details.

Exception Group support requires Self-Hosted Sentry [version 23.5.1](https://github.com/getsentry/self-hosted/releases/tag/23.5.1) or newer.

- **feat(replay): Add a new option `networkDetailDenyUrls` (#8439)**

This release adds a new option `networkDetailDenyUrls` to the `Replay` integration. This option allows you to specify a list of URLs that should not be captured by the `Replay` integration, which can be used alongside the existing `networkDetailAllowUrls` for finely grained control of which URLs should have network details captured.

```js
Sentry.init({
  integrations: [
    new Sentry.Integrations.Replay({
      networkDetailDenyUrls: [/^http:\/\/example.com\/test$/],
    }),
  ],
});
```

### Other Changes

- fix(nextjs): Ignore `tunnelRoute` when doing static exports (#8471)
- fix(nextjs): Use `basePath` option for `tunnelRoute` (#8454)
- fix(node): Apply source context to linked errors even when it is uncached (#8453)
- fix(node): report errorMiddleware errors as unhandled (#8048)
- fix(react): Add support for `basename` option of `createBrowserRouter` (#8457)
- fix(remix): Add explicit `@sentry/node` exports. (#8509)
- fix(remix): Don't inject trace/baggage to `redirect` and `catch` responses (#8467)
- fix(replay): Adjust slow/multi click handling (#8380)

## 7.57.0

### Important Changes

- **build: Update typescript from 3.8.3 to 4.9.5 (#8255)**

This release version [bumps the internally used typescript version from 3.8.x to 4.9.x](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/pull/8255).
We use ds-downlevel to generate two versions of our types, one for >=3.8, one for >=4.9.
This means that this change should be fully backwards compatible and not have any noticable user impact,
but if you still encounter issues please let us know.

- **feat(types): Add tracePropagationTargets to top level options (#8395)**

Instead of passing `tracePropagationTargets` to the `BrowserTracing` integration, you can now define them on the top level:

```js
Sentry.init({
  tracePropagationTargets: ['api.site.com'],
});
```

- **fix(angular): Filter out `TryCatch` integration by default (#8367)**

The Angular and Angular-ivy SDKs will not install the TryCatch integration anymore by default.
This integration conflicted with the `SentryErrorHander`, sometimes leading to duplicated errors and/or missing data on events.

- **feat(browser): Better event name handling for non-Error objects (#8374)**

When capturing non-errors via `Sentry.captureException()`, e.g. `Sentry.captureException({ prop: "custom object" })`,
we now generate a more helpful value for the synthetic exception. Instead of e.g. `Non-Error exception captured with keys: currentTarget, isTrusted, target, type`, you'll now get messages like:

```
Object captured as exception with keys: prop1, prop2
Event `MouseEvent` (type=click) captured as exception
Event `ErrorEvent` captured as exception with message `Script error.`
```

## 7.54.0

### Important Changes

- **feat(core): Add default entries to `ignoreTransactions` for Healthchecks #8191**

  All SDKs now filter out health check transactions by default.
  These are transactions where the transaction name matches typical API health check calls, such as `/^.*healthy.*$/` or `/^.  *heartbeat.*$/`. Take a look at [this list](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/blob/8c6ad156829f7c4eec34e4a67e6dd866ba482d5d/packages/core/src/integrations/inboundfilters.ts#L8C2-L16) to learn which regexes we currently use to match transaction names.
  We believe that these transactions do not provide value in most cases and we want to save you some of your quota by   filtering them out by default.
  These filters are implemented as default values for the top level `ignoreTransactions` option.

  You can disable this filtering by manually specifiying the `InboundFilters` integration and setting the   `disableTransactionDefaults` option:
  ```js
  Sentry.init({
    //...
    integrations: [new InboundFilters({ disableTransactionDefaults: true })],
  })
  ```

- **feat(replay): Add `mutationBreadcrumbLimit` and `mutationLimit` to Replay Options (#8228)**

  The previously experimental options `mutationBreadcumbLimit` and `mutationLimit` have been promoted to regular Replay   integration options.

  A high number of DOM mutations (in a single event loop) can cause performance regressions in end-users' browsers.
  Use `mutationBreadcrumbLimit` to send a breadcrumb along with your recording if the mutation limit was reached.
  Use `mutationLimit` to stop recording if the mutation limit was reached.

- **feat(sveltekit): Add source maps support for Vercel (lambda) (#8256)**
  - feat(sveltekit): Auto-detect SvelteKit adapters (#8193)

  The SvelteKit SDK can now be used if you deploy your SvelteKit app to Vercel.
  By default, the SDK's Vite plugin will detect the used adapter and adjust the source map uploading config as necessary.
  If you want to override the default adapter detection, you can specify the `adapter` option in the `sentrySvelteKit`  options:

  ```js
  // vite.config.js
  export default defineConfig({
    plugins: [
      sentrySvelteKit({
        adapter: 'vercel',
      }),
      sveltekit(),
    ],
  });
  ```

  Currently, the Vite plugin will configure itself correctly for `@sveltejs/adapter-auto`, `@sveltejs/adapter-vercel` and `@sveltejs/adapter-node`.

  **Important:** The SvelteKit SDK is not yet compatible with Vercel's edge runtime.
  It will only work for lambda functions.

### Important Next.js SDK changes:

This release adds support Vercel Cron Jobs in the Next.js SDK.
The SDK will automatically create [Sentry Cron Monitors](https://docs.sentry.io/product/crons/) for your [Vercel Cron Jobs](https://vercel.com/docs/cron-jobs) configured via `vercel.json` when deployed on Vercel.

You can opt out of this functionality by setting the `automaticVercelMonitors` option to `false`:

```js
// next.config.js
const nextConfig = {
  sentry: {
    automaticVercelMonitors: false,
  },
};
```

(Note: Sentry Cron Monitoring is currently in beta and subject to change. Help us make it better by letting us know what you think. Respond on [GitHub](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/discussions/42283) or write to us at crons-feedback@sentry.io)

- feat(nextjs): Add API method to wrap API routes with crons instrumentation (#8084)
- feat(nextjs): Add automatic monitors for Vercel Cron Jobs (#8088)

### Other changes

**Replay `rrweb` changes:**

`@sentry-internal/rrweb` was updated from 1.106.0 to 1.108.0:

- fix: Fix some input masking (esp for radio buttons) ([#85](https://github.com/getsentry/rrweb/pull/85))
- fix: Unescaped `:` in CSS rule from Safari ([#86](https://github.com/getsentry/rrweb/pull/86))
- feat: Define custom elements (web components) ([#87](https://github.com/getsentry/rrweb/pull/87))

Work in this release contributed by @sreetamdas. Thank you for your contribution!

## 7.51.0

### Important Changes

- **feat(sveltekit): Auto-wrap `load` functions with proxy module (#7994)**

`@sentry/sveltekit` now auto-wraps `load` functions in

* `+(page|layout).(ts|js)` files (universal loads)
* `+(page|layout).server.(ts|js)` files (server-only loads)

This means that you don't have to manually add the `wrapLoadWithSentry` and `wrapServerLoadWithSentry` functions around your load functions. The SDK will not interfere with already wrapped `load` functions.

For more details, take a look at the [Readme](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/blob/develop/packages/sveltekit/README.md#configure-auto-instrumentation)

- **chore(angular): Upgrade `peerDependencies` to Angular 16 (#8035)**

We now officially support Angular 16 in `@sentry/angular-ivy`.
Note that `@sentry/angular` _does not_ support Angular 16.

- **feat(node): Add ability to send cron monitor check ins (#8039)**

**Note: This release contains a bug with generating cron monitors. We recommend you upgrade the JS SDK to 7.51.1 or above to use cron monitoring functionality**

This release adds [Sentry cron monitoring](https://docs.sentry.io/product/crons/) support to the Node SDK.

Check-in monitoring allows you to track a job's progress by completing two check-ins: one at the start of your job and another at the end of your job. This two-step process allows Sentry to notify you if your job didn't start when expected (missed) or if it exceeded its maximum runtime (failed).

```ts
const Sentry = require('@sentry/node');

// 🟡 Notify Sentry your job is running:
const checkInId = Sentry.captureCheckIn({
  monitorSlug: '<monitor-slug>',
  status: 'in_progress',
});

// Execute your scheduled task here...

// 🟢 Notify Sentry your job has completed successfully:
Sentry.captureCheckIn({
  // make sure you pass in the checkInId generated by the first call to captureCheckIn
  checkInId,
  monitorSlug: '<monitor-slug>',
  status: 'ok',
});
```

If your job execution fails, you can notify Sentry about the failure:

```javascript
// 🔴 Notify Sentry your job has failed:
Sentry.captureCheckIn({
  checkInId,
  monitorSlug: '<monitor-slug>',
  status: 'error',
});
```

Work in this release contributed by @srubin and @arjenbrandenburgh. Thank you for your contributions!

## 7.50.0

### Important Changes

- **doc(sveltekit): Promote the SDK to beta state (#7976)**
  - feat(sveltekit): Convert `sentryHandle` to a factory function (#7975)

With this release, the Sveltekit SDK ([@sentry/sveltekit](./packages/sveltekit/README.md)) is promoted to Beta.
This means that we do not expect any more breaking changes.

The final breaking change is that `sentryHandle` is now a function.
So in order to update to 7.50.0, you have to update your `hooks.server.js` file:

```js
// hooks.server.js

// Old:
export const handle = sentryHandle;
// New:
export const handle = sentryHandle();
```

- **feat(replay): Allow to configure URLs to capture network bodies/headers (#7953)**

You can now capture request/response bodies & headers of network requests in Replay.
You have to define an allowlist of URLs you want to capture additional information for:

```js
new Replay({
  networkDetailAllowUrls: ['https://sentry.io/api'],
});
```

By default, we will capture request/response bodies, as well as the request/response headers `content-type`, `content-length` and `accept`.
You can configure this with some additional configuration:

```js
new Replay({
  networkDetailAllowUrls: ['https://sentry.io/api'],
  // opt-out of capturing bodies
  networkCaptureBodies: false,
  // These headers are captured _in addition to_ the default headers
  networkRequestHeaders: ['X-Custom-Header'],
  networkResponseHeaders: ['X-Custom-Header', 'X-Custom-Header-2']
});
```

Note that bodies will be truncated to a max length of ~150k characters.

**- feat(replay): Changes of sampling behavior & public API**
  - feat(replay): Change the behavior of error-based sampling (#7768)
  - feat(replay): Change `flush()` API to record current event buffer (#7743)
  - feat(replay): Change `stop()` to flush and remove current session (#7741)

We have changed the behavior of error-based sampling, as well as adding & adjusting APIs a bit to be more aligned with expectations.
See [Sampling](./packages/replay/README.md#sampling) for details.

We've also revamped some public APIs in order to be better aligned with expectations. See [Stoping & Starting Replays manually](./packages/replay/README.md#stopping--starting-replays-manually) for details.

- **feat(core): Add multiplexed transport (#7926)**

We added a new transport to support multiplexing.
With this, you can configure Sentry to send events to different DSNs, depending on a logic of your choosing:

```js
import { makeMultiplexedTransport } from '@sentry/core';
import { init, captureException, makeFetchTransport } from '@sentry/browser';

function dsnFromFeature({ getEvent }) {
  const event = getEvent();
  switch(event?.tags?.feature) {
    case 'cart':
      return ['__CART_DSN__'];
    case 'gallery':
      return ['__GALLERY_DSN__'];
  }
  return []
}

init({
  dsn: '__FALLBACK_DSN__',
  transport: makeMultiplexedTransport(makeFetchTransport, dsnFromFeature)
});
```

## 7.49.0

### Important Changes

- **feat(sveltekit): Read adapter output directory from `svelte.config.js` (#7863)**

Our source maps upload plugin is now able to read `svelte.config.js`. This is necessary to automatically find the output directory that users can specify when setting up the Node adapter.

- **fix(replay): Ensure we normalize scope breadcrumbs to max. depth to avoid circular ref (#7915)**

This release fixes a potential problem with how Replay captures console logs.
Any objects logged will now be cut off after a maximum depth of 10, as well as cutting off any properties after the 1000th.
This should ensure we do not accidentally capture massive console logs, where a stringified object could reach 100MB or more.

- **fix(utils): Normalize HTML elements as string (#7916)**

We used to normalize references to HTML elements as POJOs.
This is both not very easily understandable, as well as potentially large, as HTML elements may have properties attached to them.
With this change, we now normalize them to e.g. `[HTMLElement: HTMLInputElement]`.

## 7.48.0

### Important Changes

- **feat(node): Add `AsyncLocalStorage` implementation of `AsyncContextStrategy` (#7800)**
  - feat(core): Extend `AsyncContextStrategy` to allow reuse of existing context (#7778)
  - feat(core): Make `runWithAsyncContext` public API (#7817)
  - feat(core): Add async context abstraction (#7753)
  - feat(node): Adds `domain` implementation of `AsyncContextStrategy` (#7767)
  - feat(node): Auto-select best `AsyncContextStrategy` for Node.js version (#7804)
  - feat(node): Migrate to domains used through `AsyncContextStrategy` (#7779)

This release switches the SDK to use [`AsyncLocalStorage`](https://nodejs.org/api/async_context.html#class-asynclocalstorage) as the async context isolation mechanism in the SDK for Node 14+. For Node 10 - 13, we continue to use the Node [`domain`](https://nodejs.org/api/domain.html) standard library, since `AsyncLocalStorage` is not supported there. **Preliminary testing showed [a 30% improvement in latency and rps](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/issues/7691#issuecomment-1504009089) when making the switch from domains to `AsyncLocalStorage` on Node 16.**

If you want to manually add async context isolation to your application, you can use the new `runWithAsyncContext` API.

```js
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/node';

const requestHandler = (ctx, next) => {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    Sentry.runWithAsyncContext(async () => {
      const hub = Sentry.getCurrentHub();

      hub.configureScope(scope =>
        scope.addEventProcessor(event =>
          Sentry.addRequestDataToEvent(event, ctx.request, {
            include: {
              user: false,
            },
          })
        )
      );

      try {
        await next();
      } catch (err) {
        reject(err);
      }
      resolve();
    });
  });
};
```

If you're manually using domains to isolate Sentry data, we strongly recommend switching to this API!

In addition to exporting `runWithAsyncContext` publicly, the SDK also uses it internally where we previously used domains.

- **feat(sveltekit): Remove `withSentryViteConfig` (#7789)**
  - feat(sveltekit): Remove SDK initialization via dedicated files (#7791)

This release removes our `withSentryViteConfig` wrapper we previously instructed you to add to your `vite.config.js` file. It is replaced Vite plugins which you simply add to your Vite config, just like the `sveltekit()` Vite plugins. We believe this is a more transparent and Vite/SvelteKit-native way of applying build time modifications. Here's how to use the plugins:

```js
// vite.config.js
import { sveltekit } from '@sveltejs/kit/vite';
import { sentrySvelteKit } from '@sentry/sveltekit';

export default {
  plugins: [sentrySvelteKit(), sveltekit()],
  // ... rest of your Vite config
};
```

Take a look at the [`README`](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/blob/develop/packages/sveltekit/README.md) for updated instructions!

Furthermore, with this transition, we removed the possibility to intialize the SDK in dedicated `sentry.(client|server).config.js` files. Please use SvelteKit's [hooks files](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/blob/develop/packages/sveltekit/README.md#2-client-side-setup) to initialize the SDK.

Please note that these are **breaking changes**! We're sorry for the inconvenience but the SvelteKit SDK is still in alpha stage and we want to establish a clean and SvelteKit-friendly API before making the SDK stable. You have been [warned](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/blob/eb921275f9c572e72c2348a91cb39fcbb8275b8d/packages/sveltekit/README.md#L20-L24) ;)

- **feat(sveltekit): Add Sentry Vite Plugin to upload source maps (#7811)**

This release adds automatic upload of source maps to the SvelteKit SDK. No need to configure anything other than adding our Vite plugins to your SDK. The example above shows you how to do this.

Please make sure to follow the [`README`](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/blob/develop/packages/sveltekit/README.md#uploading-source-maps) to specify your Sentry auth token, as well as org and project slugs.

**- feat(replay): Capture request & response headers (#7816)**

Replay now captures the `content-length`, `content-type`, and `accept` headers from requests and responses automatically.

## 7.47.0

### Important Changes

- **feat(browser)**: Add captureUserFeedback (#7729)

This release adds a new API, `Sentry.captureUserFeedback`, to browser-side SDKs that allows you to send user feedback to Sentry without loading and opening Sentry's user feedback dialog. This allows you to obtain user feedback however and whenever you want to and simply send it to Sentry using the SDK.

For instance, you can collect feedback, whenever convenient as shown in this example:

```js
const eventId = Sentry.captureMessage('User Feedback');
const user = Sentry.getCurrentHub().getScope().getUser();
const userFeedback = {
  event_id: eventId;
  email: user.email
  name: user.username
  comments: 'I really like your App, thanks!'
}
Sentry.captureUserFeedback(userFeedback);
```

Note that feedback needs to be coupled to an event but as in the example above, you can just use `Sentry.captureMessage` to generate one.

You could also collect feedback in a custom way if an error happens and use the SDK to send it along:
```js
Sentry.init({
  dsn: '__DSN__',
  beforeSend: event => {
    const userFeedback = collectYourUserFeedback();
    const feedback = {
      ...userFeedback,
      event_id: event.event_id.
    }
    Sentry.captureUserFeedback(feedback);
    return event;
  }
})
```

- **feat(tracing)**: Deprecate `@sentry/tracing` exports (#7611)

With this release, we officially deprecate all exports from the `@sentry/tracing` package, in favour of using them directly from the main SDK package. The `@sentry/tracing` package will be removed in a future major release.

Please take a look at the [Migration docs](./MIGRATION.md/#remove-requirement-for-sentrytracing-package-since-7460) for more details.

## 7.46.0

### Important Changes

- **feat(sveltekit)**: Add Performance Monitoring for SvelteKit
  - feat(sveltekit): Add meta tag for backend -> frontend (#7574)
  - fix(sveltekit): Explicitly export Node SDK exports (#7644)
  - fix(sveltekit): Handle nested server calls in `sentryHandle` (#7598)
  - ref(sveltekit): Split up universal and server load wrappers (#7652)

This release adds support for Performance Monitoring in our SvelteKit SDK for the client/server. We've also changed how you should initialize your SDK. Please read our updated [SvelteKit README instructions](./packages/sveltekit/README.md) for more details.

- **feat(core)**: Add `ignoreTransactions` option (#7594)

You can now easily filter out certain transactions from being sent to Sentry based on their name.

```ts
Sentry.init({
  ignoreTransactions: ['/api/healthcheck', '/ping'],
})
```

- **feat(node)**: Undici integration (#7582)
  - feat(nextjs): Add Undici integration automatically (#7648)
  - feat(sveltekit): Add Undici integration by default (#7650)

We've added an integration that automatically instruments [Undici](https://github.com/nodejs/undici) and Node server side fetch. This supports Undici `v4.7.0` or higher and requires Node `v16.7.0` or higher. After adding the integration outgoing requests made by Undici will have associated spans and breadcrumbs in Sentry.

```ts
Sentry.init({
  integrations: [new Sentry.Integrations.Undici()],
})
```

In our Next.js and SvelteKit SDKs, this integration is automatically added.

- **feat(node)**: Add Sentry tRPC middleware (#7511)

We've added a new middleware for [trpc](https://trpc.io/) that automatically adds TRPC information to Sentry transactions. This middleware is meant to be used in combination with a Sentry server integration (Next.js, Express, etc).

```ts
import { initTRPC } from '@trpc/server';
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/node';

const t = initTRPC.context().create();
const sentryMiddleware = t.middleware(
  Sentry.Handlers.trpcMiddleware({
    attachRpcInput: true,
  }),
);

const sentrifiedProcedure = t.procedure.use(sentryMiddleware);
```

- **feat(tracing)**: Remove requirement for `@sentry/tracing` package

With `7.46.0` you no longer require the `@sentry/tracing` package to use tracing and performance monitoring with the Sentry JavaScript SDKs. The `@sentry/tracing` package will be removed in a future major release, but can still be used with no changes.

Please see the [Migration docs](./MIGRATION.md/#remove-requirement-for-sentrytracing-package-since-7460) for more details.

- **fix(node)**: Convert debugging code to callbacks to fix memory leak in `LocalVariables` integration (#7637)

This fixes a memory leak in the opt-in [`LocalVariables` integration](https://blog.sentry.io/2023/02/01/local-variables-for-nodejs-in-sentry/), which adds local variables to the stacktraces sent to Sentry. The minimum recommended version to use the `LocalVariables` is now `7.46.0`.

### Additional Features and Fixes

- feat(node): Auto discovery only returns integrations where dependency loads (#7603)
- feat(node): Sanitize URLs in Span descriptions and breadcrumbs (PII) (#7667)

Related to this, the `hasTracingEnabled` utility function was moved from `@sentry/tracing` to `@sentry/core`.
The old export from `@sentry/tracing` has been deprecated and will be removed in v8.

## 7.31.1

- build(replay): Provide full browser+tracing+replay bundle (#6793)
- feat(nextjs): Disable NextJS perf monitoring when using otel (#6820)
- fix(nextjs): Add back browser field in package.json (#6809)
- fix(nextjs): Connect Edge API route errors to span (#6806)
- fix(nextjs): Correctly handle ts middleware files (#6816)

## 7.31.0

The Next.js SDK now supports error and performance monitoring for Next.js [middleware](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/middleware) and [Edge API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/edge-api-routes).
To set it up, add a `sentry.edge.config.js` or `sentry.edge.config.ts` file to the root of your project and initialize the SDK:

```js
// sentry.edge.config.js or sentry.edge.config.ts

import * as Sentry from "@sentry/nextjs";

const SENTRY_DSN = process.env.SENTRY_DSN || process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN;

Sentry.init({
  dsn: SENTRY_DSN || "YOUR DSN HERE",
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
});
```

The Next.js will automatically instrument Edge API routes and middleware.
If you want to opt out of automatic instrumentation of middleware can use the `autoInstrumentMiddleware` option in the `sentry` object of your Next.js configuration:

```javascript
const moduleExports = {
  sentry: {
    autoInstrumentMiddleware: false,
  },
};
```

Middleware can be manually instrumented by using the `wrapMiddlewareWithSentry` function.

## 7.24.0

This release bumps the [`@sentry/replay`](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/blob/master/packages/replay/README.md) package from version 0.x to 7.24.0.
Along with this version bump, we're introducing a few breaking changes.
Take a look at the [Replay migration guide](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/blob/master/packages/replay/MIGRATION.md) for further information.
The Replay version bump is the result of moving the package into the Sentry JavaScript SDK monorepo which aligns the version with our other JS SDK packages.

## 7.17.1

This release standardizes our SDKs to use the MIT License, which is our [standard license for Sentry SDKs](https://open.sentry.io/licensing/). We were previously using the BSD 3-Clause License in `@sentry/browser`,`@sentry/core`, `@sentry/gatsby`, `@sentry/hub`, `@sentry/integrations`, `@sentry/node`, `@sentry/react`, `@sentry/types`, `@sentry/typescript`, and `@sentry/utils`.

This release also updates the behaviour of [`tracingOrigins`](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/performance/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/#tracingorigins) to no longer affect span creation. `tracingOrigins` will only affect if `sentry-trace` and `baggage` headers are attached to outgoing requests. To control span creation, use the [`shouldCreateSpanForRequest`](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/performance/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/#shouldcreatespanforrequest) option.

## 7.12.0

This release adds an environment check in `@sentry/nextjs` for Vercel deployments (using the `VERCEL_ENV` env variable), and only enables `SentryWebpackPlugin` if the environment is `production`. To override this, [setting `disableClientWebpackPlugin` or `disableServerWebpackPlugin` to `false`](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/nextjs/manual-setup/#disable-sentrywebpackplugin) now takes precedence over other checks, rather than being a no-op. Note: Overriding this is not recommended! It can increase build time and clog Release Health data in Sentry with inaccurate noise.

## 7.8.0

This release adds the `transpileClientSDK` flag to the Next.JS SDK Webpack config. This option makes WebPack transpile the SDK code to the same transpilation level as the user code. By specifying this option, the Next.JS SDK works in older browsers that do not support ES6 or ES6+ (e.g. object spread) features.

## 7.5.1

This release removes the `user_id` and the `transaction` field from the dynamic sampling context data that is attached to outgoing requests as well as sent to Relay.

- ref(tracing): Remove transaction name and user_id from DSC (#5363)

## 7.5.0

This release adds the `sendDefaultPii` flag to the `Sentry.init` options.
When using performance monitoring capabilities of the SDK, it controls whether user IDs (set via `Sentry.setUser`) are propagated in the `baggage` header of outgoing HTTP requests.
This flag is set to `false` per default, and acts as an opt-in mechanism for sending potentially sensitive data.
If you want to attach user IDs to Sentry transactions and traces, set this flag to `true` but keep in mind that this is potentially sensitive information.

- feat(sdk): Add sendDefaultPii option to the JS SDKs (#5341)
- fix(remix): Sourcemaps upload script is missing in the tarball (#5356)
- fix(remix): Use cjs for main entry point (#5352)

## 7.0.0

Version 7 of the Sentry JavaScript SDK brings a variety of features and fixes including bundle size and performance improvements, brand new integrations, support for the attachments API, and key bug fixes.

This release does not change or remove any top level public API methods (`captureException`, `captureMessage`), and only requires changes to certain configuration options or custom clients/integrations/transports.

**Note: The v7 version of the JavaScript SDK requires a self-hosted version of Sentry 20.6.0 or higher. If you are using a version of [self-hosted Sentry](https://develop.sentry.dev/self-hosted/) (aka onpremise) older than `20.6.0` then you will need to [upgrade](https://develop.sentry.dev/self-hosted/releases/).**

For detailed overview of all the changes, please see our [v7 migration guide](./MIGRATION.md#upgrading-from-6x-to-7x).

### Breaking Changes

If you are a regular consumer of the Sentry JavaScript SDK you only need to focus on the general items. The internal breaking changes are aimed at libraries that build on top of and extend the JavaScript SDK (like [`@sentry/electron`](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-electron/) or [`@sentry/react-native`](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-react-native/)).

#### General

- [Updated CommonJS distributions to use ES6 by default](./MIGRATION.md#moving-to-es6-for-commonjs-files). If you need to support Internet Explorer 11 or old Node.js versions, we recommend using a preprocessing tool like [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) to convert Sentry packages to ES5. (#5005)
- Default `bundle.min.js` to ES6 instead of ES5. [ES5 bundles are still available at `bundle.es5.min.js`](./MIGRATION.md#renaming-of-cdn-bundles). (#4958)
- Updated build system to use TypeScript 3.8.3 (#4895)
- Deprecated `Severity` enum for bundle size reasons. [Please use string literals instead](./MIGRATION.md#severity-severitylevel-and-severitylevels). (#4926)
- Removed `critical` Severity level. (#5032)
- `whitelistUrls` and `blacklistUrls` have been renamed to `allowUrls` and `denyUrls` in the `Sentry.init()` options. (#4850)
- `BaseClient` and it's child classes now require `transport`, `stackParser`, and `integrations` to be [explicitly passed in](./MIGRATION.md#explicit-client-options). This was done to improve tree-shakability. (#4927)
- Updated package distribution structure and stopped distributing CDN bundles through `@sentry/*` npm packages. [See details in our migration docs.](./MIGRATION.md#restructuring-of-package-content). (#4900) (#4901)
- [Simplified `Transport` API](./MIGRATION.md#transport-changes). This means [custom transports will have to be adjusted accordingly.](./MIGRATION.md#custom-transports).
- Updated how [Node Transport Options are passed down](./MIGRATION.md#node-transport-changes).
- Start propogating [`baggage` HTTP header](https://www.w3.org/TR/baggage/) alongside `sentry-trace` header to [propogate additional tracing related information.](./MIGRATION.md#propagation-of-baggage-header). (#5133)
- Renamed `registerRequestInstrumentation` export to `instrumentOutgoingRequests` in `@sentry/tracing`. (#4859)
- Renamed `UserAgent` integration to `HttpContext`. (#5027)
- Replaced `BrowserTracing` integration's `maxTransactionDuration` option with `finalTimeout` option in the `@sentry/tracing` package and reset `idleTimeout` based on activities count. This should improve accuracy of web-vitals like LCP by 20-30%. (#5044)
- [Updated `@sentry/angular` to be compiled by the angular compiler](./MIGRATION.md#sentry-angular-sdk-changes). (#4641)
- Made tracing package treeshakable (#5166)
- Removed support for [Node v6](./MIGRATION.md#dropping-support-for-nodejs-v6). (#4851)
- Removed `@sentry/minimal` package in favour of using [`@sentry/hub`](./MIGRATION.md#removal-of-sentryminimal). (#4971)
- Removed support for Opera browser pre v15 (#4923)
- Removed `ignoreSentryErrors` option from AWS lambda SDK. Errors originating from the SDK will now *always* be caught internally. (#4994)
- Removed `Integrations.BrowserTracing` export from `@sentry/nextjs`. Please import `BrowserTracing` from `@sentry/nextjs` directly.
- Removed static `id` property from `BrowserTracing` integration.
- Removed `SDK_NAME` export from `@sentry/browser`, `@sentry/node`, `@sentry/tracing` and `@sentry/vue` packages. (#5040)
- Removed `Angular`, `Ember`, and `Vue` integrations from `@sentry/integrations` [in favour of the explicit framework packages: `@sentry/angular`, `@sentry/ember`, and `@sentry/vue`](./MIGRATION.md#removal-of-old-platform-integrations-from-sentryintegrations-package). (#4893)
- Removed [enums `Status`, `RequestSessionStatus`, and `SessionStatus`.](./MIGRATION.md#removed-enums). Deprecated [enums `SpanStatus` and `Severity`](./MIGRATION.md#deprecated-enums). This was done to save on bundle size. (#4891) (#4889) (#4890)
- Removed support for deprecated `@sentry/apm` package. (#4845)
- Removed deprecated `user` field from DSN interface. `publicKey` should be used instead. (#4864)
- Removed deprecated `getActiveDomain` method and `DomainAsCarrier` type from `@sentry/hub`. (#4858)
- Removed `eventStatusFromHttpCode` to save on bundle size.
- Removed usage of deprecated `event.stacktrace` field. (#4885)
- Removed raven-node backward-compat code (#4942)
- Removed `showReportDialog` method on `BrowserClient` (#4973)
- Removed deprecated `startSpan` and `child` methods (#4849)
- Removed deprecated `frameContextLines` options (#4884)
- Removed `Sentry` from window in the Gatsby SDK (#4857)

#### Internal

- Removed support for the store endpoint (#4969)
- Made hint callback argument non-optional (#5141)
- Switched to using new transports internally (#4943)
- [Removed `API` class from `@sentry/core`.](./MIGRATION.md#removing-the-api-class-from-sentrycore). (#4848)
- [Refactored `Session` class to use a more functional approach.](./MIGRATION.md#session-changes). (#5054)
- Removed `Backend` class in favour of moving functionality into the `Client` class (for more details, see [#4911](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/pull/4911) and [#4919](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/pull/4919)).
- Removed forget async utility function (#4941)
- Removed tslint from `@sentry-internal/typescript` (#4940)
- Removed `_invokeClient` function from `@sentry/hub` (#4972)
- Removed top level eventbuilder exports (#4887)

## 6.19.1

This release fixes a bug from 6.19.0 causing type import errors in most JS SDKs.

- fix(types): Point to type definitions in dist folder (#4745)

## 6.19.0

This release makes a change to the data normalization process, limiting the number of entries or properties which will be included in any given array or object to 1000. Previously there was no limit, so in rare cases you may notice a change in your context data. If this is a problem, you can increase the limit with the new `maxNormalizationBreadth` setting. See [#4689](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/pull/4689) for details.

## 6.18.2

If you are using `@sentry-internal/eslint-config-sdk`, please note that this release turns on the [quotes rule](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/quotes) to enforce usage of single quotes.

This release also removes `@sentry/tracing` as a dependency of `@sentry/node`. Please explicitly install and import `@sentry/tracing` if you want to use performance monitoring capabilities. For more details, [see our docs on setting up Node Performance Monitoring](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/node/performance/).

We also now produce an ES6 version of our [CDN tracing bundle](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/install/cdn/#performance-bundle), which can be accessed with `bundle.tracing.es6.min.js`.

- chore(eslint): Turn on quotes rules (#4671)
- fix(node): prevent errors thrown on flush from breaking response (#4667)
- ref(node): Remove dependency on @sentry/tracing (#4647)

## 6.18.0

This patch deprecates the `frameContextLines` option for the Node SDK. The [migration documentation](./MIGRATION.md#upgrading-from-6.17.x-to-6.18.0) details how to migrate off the deprecated `frameContextLines` option.

Work in this release contributed by @mobilestar1. Thank you for your contribution!

## 6.17.5

This release deprecates the `Severity` enum, the `SeverityLevel` type, and the internal `SeverityLevels` array, all from `@sentry/types`. In v7, `Severity` will disappear (in favor of `SeverityLevel`) and `SeverityLevel` and `SeverityLevels` will live in `@sentry/utils`. If you are using any of the three, we encourage you to migrate your usage now, using our [migration guide](./MIGRATION.md#upgrading-from-6.x-to-6.17.x).

- ref: Export Session class from core/browser/node (#4508)
- chore(nextjs): Bump`@sentry/webpack-plugin` to 1.18.5 (#4501)
- ref(types): Move SeverityLevel and SeverityLevels to `@sentry/utils` (#4492)

## 6.17.3

- fix(nextjs): Unwrap `req` and `res` if necessary when instrumenting server (#4467)

## 6.17.2

This patch contains a breaking change for anyone setting the undocumented `rethrowAfterCapture` option for `@sentry/serverless`'s AWS wrapper to `false`, as its functionality has been removed. For backwards compatibility with anyone setting it to `true` (which is also the default), the option remains in the `WrapperOptions` type for now. It will be removed in the next major release, though, so we recommend removing it from your code.

- ref(serverless): Remove `rethrowAfterCapture` use in AWS lambda wrapper (#4448)
- fix(utils): Remove dom `is` casting (#4451)

## 6.17.0

This release contains several internal refactors that help reduce the bundle size of the SDK and help prep for our [upcoming major release](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-javascript/issues/4240). There are no breaking changes in this patch unless you are using our internal `Dsn` class, which has been removed. We also deprecated a few of our typescript enums and our internal `API` class. We've detailed in our [migration documentation](./MIGRATION.md#upgrading-from-6.x-to-6.17.x) how to update your sdk usage if you are using any of these in your code.

## 6.0.0

_This major version release doesn't contain any breaking API/code changes._ Starting from the version `6.0.0`, all SDKs
that support sending sessions data will do so by default. See our
[Release Health](https://docs.sentry.io/product/releases/health/) docs to learn more. As of this version, it applies to
all Browser SDKs (Browser, React, Angular, Vue, Gatsby etc.). Node.js and other related Server SDKs will follow soon
after, in the minor `6.x` release. You can opt-out of this behavior by setting `autoSessionTracking: false` option
during SDK initialization.

_If you are a `@sentry/apm` and did manual instrumentation using `hub.startSpan` please be aware of the changes we did
to the API. The recommended entry point for manual instrumentation now is `Sentry.startTransaction` and creating child
Span by calling `startChild` on it. We have internal workarounds in place so the old code should still work but will be
removed in the future. If you are only using the `Tracing` integration there is no need for action._

## 4.0.0

This is the release of our new SDKs, `@sentry/browser`, `@sentry/node`. While there are too many changes to list for
this release, we will keep a consistent changelog for upcoming new releases. `raven-js` (our legacy JavaScript/Browser
SDK) and `raven` (our legacy Node.js SDK) will still reside in this repo, but they will receive their own changelog.

We generally guide people to use our new SDKs from this point onward. The migration should be straightforward if you
were only using the basic features of our previous SDKs.

`raven-js` and `raven` will both still receive bugfixes but all the new features implemented will only work in the new
SDKs. The new SDKs are completely written in TypeScript, which means all functions, classes and properties are typed.

### Migration

Here are some examples of how the new SDKs work. Please note that the API for all JavaScript SDKs is the same.

#### Installation

_Old_:

```js
Raven.config('___PUBLIC_DSN___', {
  release: '1.3.0',
}).install();
```

_New_:

```js
Sentry.init({
  dsn: '___PUBLIC_DSN___',
  release: '1.3.0',
});
```

#### Set a global tag

_Old_:

```js
Raven.setTagsContext({ key: 'value' });
```

_New_:

```js
Sentry.configureScope((scope) => {
  scope.setTag('key', 'value');
});
```

#### Capture custom exception

_Old_:

```js
try {
